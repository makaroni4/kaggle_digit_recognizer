# Digit Recognizer for Kaggle

Reusing some of my [Coursera ML](https://github.com/makaroni4/coursera_ml_course) course submissions to play with [digit recognition in Kaggle](https://github.com/makaroni4/coursera_ml_course).

`test.csv` and `train.csv` were downloaded from Kaggle and contain [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset.

## How to run

So far it's 3 layer NN (784-25-10) with fixed regularization param lambda hardcoded to 1.
